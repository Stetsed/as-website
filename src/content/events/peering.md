So, you want to peer with AS-SELFHOSTABLE. We try to make this as simple as possible to allow a larger network of directly connected nodes to coexist meaning there is less reliance on upstreams due to the direct connected nature. We do have some minor requirements to be able to peer with us, these aren't anything major but just to filter out trolls/people who are not serious or have malicious intent.

## Requirements

- Registerd and Active ASN
- Have presence within an IXP we have presence at
- Have up-to-date and accurate PeeringDB Profile
- Pledge to not point any static/default-routes towards us.
- Have IPv6 as we at this time do not handel IPv4
- Have functioning and active RPKI

## Contact

For peering requests, please communicate the below details to our e-mail at <a href="text-blue-600" href="mailto:noc@selfhostable.net">noc@selfhostable.net</a>. You can find the IP's of our POP's on the IXP's on our routingDB profile (here)

- ASN: (Your Registerd ASN)
- IXP: (Internet Exchange your requesting to peer over)
- IPv6: (IPv6 Address for Peering)
- NOC E-mail: (Your NOC e-mail)
- NOC Phone Number: (If you have one)


## Response

We will return back to you within 1-2 Business Days, where there may be extra verification if we see anything suspicious, otherwise we will add the peer on our side as swiftly as we can and wait for your side to do the same and hopefully there will be no issues and we will be peered.

We look forward to your peering request as we continue to advance our network reach. Have a wonderful rest of your day and may we speak soon.
